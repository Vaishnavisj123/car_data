# 🚗 Car Data Analysis

This project analyzes car-related data to gain insights into various factors such as price, mileage, fuel efficiency, and other key performance metrics. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing data.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Graphs and plots for better insights.
- 🔎 **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between different car attributes.
- 📉 **Predictive Modeling (if applicable)**: Estimating price or fuel efficiency based on given attributes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computing)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For interactive analysis)

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains attributes such as:
  - Car brand and model
  - Year of manufacture
  - Price
  - Mileage (km/l)
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
  - Engine specifications
